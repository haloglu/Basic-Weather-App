# Weather App
This is a simple web application that displays the current weather conditions by querying OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to use
Clone the repository to your computer or run it on GitHub.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter a city name in the search box and click on the "Search" button.
The weather results will be displayed in the result box.

## Dependencies
This project is built using JavaScript and CSS. It also uses OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information.

## Code Description
This code uses the fetch function to get the weather information for a specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API. It then parses the JSON response and displays the weather information on the web page. If the city entered is not found, the code displays an error message. The code also changes the weather icon based on the current weather conditions.
